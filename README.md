# Smart-Socks
A smart sock that can collect temperature, pressure, motion ( x,y,z axis and coordinates , and acceleration) , humidity, and is able to vibrate. I created this to have many variety of data to be used to predict if the person wearing the sock is at a high risk for dietetic foot or other risks with deep learning. 

# Currently researching
1. making a pressure, humidity, and temp sensor. Maybe acidity (ph) sensor. 
    1. because it'll be smaller, flexable, and more comfortable to have in the sock.
        1. video talking about [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVS2WyRxELw).
        2. Reseach [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/295396824_Paper_Skin_Multisensory_Platform_for_Simultaneous_Environmental_Monitoring)

# DIY pressure pad sensor with condutive threads and piezo-resistive conductive sheet

Piezo-resistive conductive sheet works by decreasing the resistance of the sheet when force is being exerted on to it allowing the current to flow through it. 

I am concerned that the DIY pressure pad will reach it's max "pressure" such as when it's met with the force of a persons weight you will see all the same numbers. 

Another thing i worry about is if we dont make the thread the same length one will have more resistance compared to the other ones or if the thread is too long then the signal we get back could be unusable.

Another thing to consider is when conductive threads or fabrics are stretched or compressed the conductivity increases. 

1. Easy to make with [condutive threads](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10867) and [Piezo-resistive condutive sheet](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1361)
