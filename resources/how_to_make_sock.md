1. when cutting the temp sensor out of aluminum foil make sure to use a paper slightly thicker than a printer paper and use spray glue to glue the foil to the paper. make sure the cutting mat has good enough adhesive because if you dont then it will mess up the cut. I use the consruction paper mode on cricut. 


1. To send data from arduino to android app:
    1. Use HC-05 module to send data via bluetooth to the app [link](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Receive-Arduino-Sensor-Data-on-Your-Android/)
2. POC of a DIY pressure pad with conductive fabrics:
