# How does this work?
The velostat is basically a variable resistor. You can change the resistance of the material by applying force.

You make a conductive material sandwich where the velostat is sandwiched between two conductive materials. 

When you apply force you complete the circut and allow the current to pass through the velostat but the amount of current you let pass through varies on the pressure you apply on the velostat. Thus you get a pressure sensor.
